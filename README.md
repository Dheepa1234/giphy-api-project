# giphy-api-project

The purpose of this project is to make a dynamic web page. The web page is populated with GIFs. The learning objectives
of this project are to 1) call the GIPHY API and  2)to use Javascript and jQuery to change the HTML elements of the originating document. It is also important to have a GIPHY API key to be able to obtain the necessary data to change how the elements on the page behave. This project is based on a theme on which the appropriate GIFS will be pulled for the 
user to view.
